== Google account

We use google drive to store some of our administrative data that are non-private. If you are the admin, please contact the developer to gain access to the google account. We also uses other google services including `gmail`, `google drive`, `google calendar`.

In the google drive, there is a folder `KIWI Management Interface`. Listed below are a few excel files found in the folder.

== Menu of the day

*KIWI* `home page` displays the menu of the day and updates automatically every day. The `Menu` google sheet serves as the menu data source for webpage and also the https://t.me/HungryKEBot[HungryKE] telegram bot. 

If you want to update the menu:

If you want to change a new set of menu (for the new semester):

. Make sure the excel sheet you follows follow the bellow title format (*important*): 

 Date | Month | Breakfast1 | Breakfast2 | Breakfast3 | Breakfast4 | Breakfast5 | Meat1 | Meat2 | Meat3 | Vege1 | Vege2 | Vege3 | Side1 | Side2 | Side3 | Side4 | Special1 | Special2 | Special3 | FruitandDessert | Soup

. Update the `Menu` google sheet with the latest menu


== Booking System

Before booking a venue, resident will have to check the calendar on the *KIWI* `Booking System Page` for availability of the venue. This `website calendar` is sync with the `google calendar` of the same google account. 

To book a venue, resident will have to submit the `Facilities Reservation Form` 3 days in advance. Upon submission, the booking will be recorded in the `Booking Submission` google sheet:

.  If the venue is available:

* an email will be sent from the gmail account to the applicant confirming his/her booking
* The status in the excel sheet will be set as `Sent: Approve`
* The booking will be added to the google calendar
* The webpage calendar will sync with the google calendar

.  If the venue is unavailable, there is a conflict in the timing:

* an email will be sent from the gmail account to the applicant rejecting his/her booking
* The status in the excel sheet will be set as `Sent: Conflict`
* Google calendar and webpage calendar remain unchanged

As an admin, you can:

* Access the `google calendar` to add/change the bookings, any changes will be updated on the `webiste calendar` automatically

* Access the *Booking Submission* google sheet to view the list of bookings and get information of the bookings including: 

 cca_name | email | purpose | date | starttime | endtime | venue | status
